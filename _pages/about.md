I am a post-doc at MIT working with [Faez Ahmed](https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/faez@MIT.EDU). Recently, I earned my Ph.D. from the Ohio State University where I worked on intelligent robotic manufacturing system and generative computational design. I was fortunate to be supervised by [David Hoelzle](https://mae.osu.edu/people/hoelzle.1). Previously, I also worked as a research intern and later a research collaborator at the [Autodesk AI Lab](https://www.research.autodesk.com/) on AI for 3D generative computational design. My core expertise includes generative AI, representation learning/reinforcement learning, optimal control theory and AI software integration in manufacturing hardware. 



My core vision is to build the next generation of manufacturing automation by taking a synergistic hardware-software approach. I envision a general purpose **Intelligent and integrated Manufacturing Operating System (IMOS)** that combines AI systems at its core for intelligent CAD/CAM/PDM/PLM, robotic manufacturing and process control. During my PhD and continuing thereafter, I have been working towards this vision by developing novel AI algorithms for computational 3D design and digital manufacturing. A significant focus of my research also includes real-time systems integration of AI-software with novel manufacturing hardware. [I have shown one of the first successful deployment of real-time AI-assisted process control in a custom built additive manufacturing system](/publications/). The algorithms that I have developed can learn to manufacture complex 3D metamaterial while requiring 10x less data samples than traditional approaches.
